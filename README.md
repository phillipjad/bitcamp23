# bitcamp23
This repository contains the code needed to 
run the Arduino UNO for my 2023 bitcamp hackathon project

This code serves as the basis for a "smart" humidifier
that actives when humidity drops belows a
certain level and runs until 
1.)reaching a more desirable level 
2.)spending its supply of water.
